# hello-world
This is a mini assignment for my Intro to Computer Science Class. It is for practicing Github Flow.

My name is Nina Lanier, and I am a junior Computer Science major at Virginia State University. In the future, I would like to be a cybersecurity specialist or a digital foresnic specialist for the government.
